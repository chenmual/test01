Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

103

120 years ago.

105

better than anyone.

133

to befriend an enemy

and keeps fighting.

Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

154

He keeps fighting.

155
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:55,509
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

156
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:58,176

climbs on a fucking dragon?

157

Wrong!

Mm!

163
00:17:57,217 --> 00:18:00,468
You were married. Before Sansa.

164
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,635
-Drink.

165
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,885
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

166
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:10,885
No!

167
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:25,843
You're a virgin.

168
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,092
That's a statement
about the present.

169
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:36,092
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

170
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,176
have you slept with a man.

171
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:40,843
Or a woman.

172
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,009
I have to piss.

173
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:53,092
We did it!
We faced those icy fucks.

174
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,760
Looked right
into their blue eyes,

175
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,217
and here we are.

176
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:02,134
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

177
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,967
Please pardon me for a moment.

178
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:29,009
MAN:
Drink it!

179
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:52,593
And after all that,

180
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:56,217
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

181
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,217
Just takes her, like that.

182
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,843
I mean it, Clegane.

183
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,509
My heart is broken.

184
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:04,843
Don't touch me.

185
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,259
WILLA:
You can touch me.

186
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,593
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

187
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,426
Maybe you should be.

188
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,051
Well, Clegane...

189
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,676
it's time to drown our sorrows.

190
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,426
I'm not done with my drink.

191
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,426
MAN 2: You saved the day.

192
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,885
MAN 1:
You owe me one.

193
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,468
-Don't forget that.
MAN 2: For the rest of my days.

194
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,051
Are you ready now?

195
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:35,259
This is my drink.

196
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,509
All right!

197
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,301
SANSA:
She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

198
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,801
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

199
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,718
And what's that?

200
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,176
That's my fucking business.

201
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:10,718
Used to be
you couldn't look at me.

202
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,051
That was a long time ago.

203
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:15,843
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

204
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,885
HOUND:
Yes, I've heard.

205
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,718
Heard you were broken in.

206
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:22,343
Heard you were broken in rough.

207
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:25,801
And he got what he deserved.

208
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,217
I gave it to him.

209
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:29,635
How?

210
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,051
Hounds.

211
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,551
You've changed, Little Bird.

212
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,384
None of it would have happened

213
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,301
if you'd left King's Landing
with me.

214
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:50,384
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

215
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,259
none of it.

216
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:04,176
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

217
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,760
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

218
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,384
MAN 1: Hey!
MAN 2: Pour another one.

219
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:44,967
Don't shoot.

220
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:50,885
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

221
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,468
You should be celebrating
with them.

222
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:54,926
I am celebrating.

223
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah, I am too.

224
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:02,926
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

225
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:06,384
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

226
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,801
By order of the queen.

227
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:11,801
Congratulations.

228
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,051
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

229
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,760
I hardly know
how to use a fork.

230
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:20,760
All I know
is that you're beautiful,

231
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:21,967
and I love you,

232
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,885
and none of it
will be worth anything

233
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,134
if you're not with me.

234
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,468
So be with me.

235
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:35,593
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

236
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:00,092
You'll be a wonderful lord,

237
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,217
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

238
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,051
But I'm not a lady.

239
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,843
I never have been.

240
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,176
That's not me.

241
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,718
You didn't drink.

242
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,593
-I didn't drink?
-In the game.

243
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:48,843
-I drank.
-In the game. This is Dornish.

244
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:55,259
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

245
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,426
Suit yourself.

246
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:10,760
You keep it
warm enough in here.

247
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:17,134
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

248
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,593
Keep your fire going.

249
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:21,009
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

250
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,718
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.

251
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:25,676
-Piss off.
-You know the first thing

252
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,551
I learned in the North?

253
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:29,718
I hate the fucking North.

254
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,092
It grows on you.

255
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,426
I don't want things
growing on me.

256
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:41,009
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

257
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,593
Has he grown on you?

258
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,259
He was very sad when you left.

259
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,593
You sound quite jealous.

260
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,926
I do, don't I?

261
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,801
It's bloody hot in here.

262
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:11,967
Oh, move aside.

263
00:26:17,635 --> 00:26:18,676
What are you doing?

264
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,134
I'm taking your shirt off.

265
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,343
I've never slept with
a knight before.

266
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:14,301
I've never slept
with anyone before.

267
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,926
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

268
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,384
I told you--

269
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,384
Are you drunk?

270
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,009
No.

271
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,343
Only a little.

272
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:02,217
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

273
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:04,885
but I know this.

274
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:08,509
If he could have chosen
a way to die,

275
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:10,593
it would have been
protecting you.

276
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,635
He loved me.

277
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,718
And I couldn't love him back.

278
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,551
Not the way he wanted.

279
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,635
Not the way I love you.

280
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,217
Is that all right?

281
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,593
I wish you'd never told me.

282
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,635
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

283
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,301
I try to forget.

284
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,343
Tonight I did for a while,

285
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:25,217
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

286
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:29,051
I saw the way
they looked at you.

287
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,509
I know that look.

288
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:36,676
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

289
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,343
Never on this side of the sea.

290
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,092
I told you I don't want it.

291
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,718
It doesn't matter what you want.

292
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:45,593
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

293
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:48,259
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

294
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:49,843
and take what is mine?

295
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:55,134
I'll refuse.

296
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,760
You are my queen. I don't know
what else I can say.

297
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,051
You can say nothing.

298
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,593
To anyone, ever.

299
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,676
Never tell them
who you really are.

300
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,176
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

301
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:07,468
and tell no one else.

302
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,176
Or it will take on
a life of its own

303
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:10,967
and you won't be able
to control it

304
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,259
or what it does to people.

305
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,843
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

306
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,885
no matter what you swear.

307
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:25,509
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

308
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,509
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

309
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:42,967
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

310
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,718
She won't.

311
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,843
She's not the girl
you grew up with.

312
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,217
Not after what she's seen,

313
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,926
not after
what they've done to her.

314
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,176
I owe them the truth.

315
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,134
Even if the truth destroys us?

316
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:02,926
-It won't.
-It will.

317
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:07,259
I've never begged
for anything...

318
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,676
but I'm begging you.

319
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Don't do this. Please.

320
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:21,760
You are my queen.

321
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,217
Nothing will change that.

322
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:29,843
And they are my family.

323
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:33,468
We can live together.

324
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,343
We can.

325
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,301
I've just told you how.

326
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,301
Half are gone.

327
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:27,635
The Northmen as well.

328
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:37,176
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

329
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,259
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

330
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:43,051
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

331
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,926
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

332
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:47,259
that we saved them--

333
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:49,676
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

334
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:53,301
We will hit her hard.

335
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:55,593
We will rip her out
root and stem.

336
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,676
The objective here
is to remove Cersei

337
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,426
without destroying
King's Landing.

338
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:09,384
VARYS:
Thankfully, she's losing allies
by the day.

339
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:12,301
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands

340
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:13,676
in her queen's name.

341
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,426
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

342
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,551
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

343
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,426
as long as she sits
on the Iron Throne,

344
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:23,217
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

345
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,301
We need the capital.

346
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:29,134
I watched the people
of King's Landing

347
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,509
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

348
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,801
and that was before
winter began.

349
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:37,426
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

350
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,509
JON:
We'll surround the city.

351
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:43,843
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

352
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:46,009
the dragons will destroy them.

353
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:48,509
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

354
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,259
we'll defeat them in the field.

355
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:54,009
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

356
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,092
her reign is over.

357
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,718
All right.

358
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:05,926
SANSA:
The men we have left
are exhausted.

359
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,217
Many of them are wounded.

360
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:09,176
They'll fight better
if they have time

361
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:10,635
to rest and recuperate.

362
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,134
How long do you suggest?

363
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,801
SANSA:
I can't say for certain,

364
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:17,926
not without
talking to the officers.

365
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:24,176
I came north
to fight alongside you

366
00:34:24,259 --> 00:34:26,801
at great cost
to my armies and myself.

367
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:30,885
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate,

368
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,760
you want to postpone.

369
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:35,718
It's not just our people.
It's yours.

370
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,426
You want to throw them
into a war

371
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,051
they're not ready to fight?

372
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:40,843
The longer I leave
my enemies alone,

373
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:42,426
the stronger they become.

374
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,509
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

375
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:50,885
and their allegiance

376
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,468
to the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

377
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,676
What you command, we will obey.

378
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:07,009
TYRION:
So...

379
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:10,009
if all are in agreement...

380
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,926
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

381
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,384
with the Northern troops

382
00:35:14,468 --> 00:35:17,009
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

383
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:19,426
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

384
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:21,426
and sail from there
to Dragonstone

385
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:25,217
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

386
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:27,967
Ser Jaime has chosen
to remain here,

387
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:30,343
as a guest
of the Lady of Winterfell.

388
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:35,301
We have won the Great War.

389
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,051
Now we will win the Last War.

390
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,343
In all Seven Kingdoms,

391
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:44,217
men will live
without fear and cruelty

392
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,718
under their rightful queen.

393
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:01,343
We need a word.

394
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:08,426
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

395
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,801
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

396
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,301
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

397
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:14,468
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell--

398
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,134
And we will never forget them.

399
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,092
That doesn't mean that I want
to kneel to someone who--

400
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,843
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

401
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:22,468
I respect that.

402
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:26,760
You respect it?

403
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,217
We needed her.

404
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:33,217
We needed her army, her dragons.

405
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:36,801
You did the right thing.

406
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,301
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

407
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:40,926
we don't trust your queen.

408
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:45,134
-You don't know her yet.
-I'll never know her.

409
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:46,509
She's not one of us.

410
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,509
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

411
00:36:48,593 --> 00:36:49,926
you won't make many allies.

412
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,551
That's all right.

413
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:53,760
I don't need many allies.

414
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:56,092
JON: Arya...
-We're family.

415
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:58,635
The four of us.

416
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,426
The last of the Starks.

417
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:06,926
I've never been a Stark.

418
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,676
SANSA:
You are.

419
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,760
You're just as much
Ned Stark's child as any of us.

420
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:14,718
You're my brother.

421
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:17,301
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

422
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:19,676
My brother.

423
00:37:27,217 --> 00:37:28,967
It's your choice.

424
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:38,343
I need to tell you something.

425
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,343
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

426
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:47,967
What is it?

427
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:52,301
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

428
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:53,967
How can I promise
to keep a secret

429
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:55,593
if I don't even
know what it is?

430
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,343
Because we're family.

431
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:03,384
Swear it.

432
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,134
I swear it.

433
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:11,801
I swear it.

434
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:21,134
Tell them.

435
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,217
TYRION:
So she's going
to stay here with you?

436
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:39,885
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

437
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,676
Say something snide.

438
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:46,885
I'm happy.

439
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,718
I'm happy that you're happy.

440
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:55,009
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

441
00:38:57,051 --> 00:39:00,343
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

442
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,843
-To climbing mountains.

443
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,384
To climbing mountains.

444
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,967
-What's she like down there?
-What?

445
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,009
That's not your concern.

446
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:15,635
I haven't been with a woman
for years.

447
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,217
-Give me a morsel.
-You're a dog.

448
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,176
I am the Imp,
and I demand to know.

449
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:21,051
BRONN:
I knew you were fucking her.

450
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,885
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

451
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,635
Must be like
looking in the mirror.

452
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:28,551
TYRION:
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

453
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,926
Where's your drink?

454
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,134
What are you--
What are you doing up North?

455
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:35,676
What are you doing with that?

456
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,301
Oh, this?

457
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,426
This is for you.

458
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:41,009
For both of you.

459
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:43,176
TYRION:
You're supposed to be south.

460
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:45,176
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

461
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,760
-Do you know that?
-That's a bit rude.

462
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,051
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

463
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:52,051
-and what do I have to show?
-You're a knight, thanks to me.

464
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:53,718
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

465
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,009
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

466
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,676
Power resides
where men believe--

467
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,718
BRONN:
Shut your mouth.

468
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,134
TYRION: I'm just trying--
-I've never hit a dwarf before,

469
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:04,092
but say another word
and I will belt you.

470
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:06,718
See, I don't believe
you'd do that, after all--

471
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,551
You couldn't do it
on your best day,

472
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:09,718
you one-handed fuck.

473
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,384
And your best days
are long gone.

474
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:12,967
You broke my nose!

475
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:14,760
-I did not break your nose.
-How do you know?

476
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:17,134
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

477
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:20,134
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

478
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,801
Your sister
offered me Riverrun.

479
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,384
Nice big castle, good lands,

480
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,509
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

481
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,259
-And you trust Cersei--
-I knew your sister was dead

482
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,134
the second I saw those dragons.

483
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:32,801
Now,
your army may be torn to shit,

484
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:35,092
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

485
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:37,676
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

486
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:41,843
If Cersei's dead,
she can't pay up.

487
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,343
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change

488
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:48,426
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

489
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:51,384
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

490
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:53,384
-All of a sudden...
TYRION: May I speak?

491
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:56,134
Why not?
Only death will shut you up.

492
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:02,343
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

493
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,593
If anyone offered me money

494
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:05,926
to kill you,
you'd pay me double.

495
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,468
What's double Riverrun?

496
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:09,509
Highgarden.

497
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,176
You could be Lord of the Reach.

498
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:16,092
-Highgarden? Are you mad?
-It's better than being dead.

499
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:17,384
He's not going to kill us.

500
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,217
He wouldn't be
talking to us if--

501
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:23,468
The way I see it,

502
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:26,217
I only need one
of the Lannister brothers alive.

503
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:28,426
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

504
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:30,635
BRONN:
No? Who were your ancestors,

505
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,885
the ones
who made your family rich?

506
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,551
Fancy lads in silk?

507
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:36,301
They were fucking cutthroats.

508
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,801
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

509
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:41,301
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

510
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:43,718
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

511
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,801
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

512
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:50,301
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

513
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:51,926
with their cocksucking ways.

514
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Highgarden.

515
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:00,092
Give me your word.

516
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,301
You have my word.

517
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:08,551
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

518
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:12,092
We ride south in the morning.

519
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:13,343
We could use an officer

520
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:15,676
with knowledge
of the city's defenses.

521
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,009
Oh, no.

522
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,676
No, my fighting days are done.

523
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,801
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

524
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,509
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

525
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:27,885
Till then, don't die.

526
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:54,801
For fuck's sake.

527
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,426
On your own?

528
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:00,134
HOUND:
Not anymore.

529
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:03,259
I don't like crowds.

530
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:05,967
ARYA:
Me neither.

531
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:09,343
HOUND:
Why not? They all love you now.

532
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:11,009
You're the big hero.

533
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,760
Don't like heroes.

534
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,176
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

535
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:22,176
Felt better than dying.

536
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:27,343
You're heading
to King's Landing?

537
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:31,051
I have some
unfinished business.

538
00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:33,801
Me too.

539
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,009
I don't plan on coming back.

540
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:46,009
Neither do I.

541
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:50,009
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

542
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:53,259
Probably.

543
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:38,509
My lady.

544
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:45,551
"My lord"
is the standard response.

545
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:49,384
Why her?

546
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:55,426
TYRION:
You know she loves your brother.

547
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,635
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

548
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:01,551
You seem determined
to dislike her.

549
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:04,176
A good relationship

550
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:05,593
between the Iron Throne
and the North

551
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:07,426
has been the core
of every peaceful,

552
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:09,092
prosperous reign
we've ever known.

553
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:10,676
Jon will be
Warden of the North,

554
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
so a good relationship
seems likely.

555
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:17,676
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

556
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Well,
I suppose that's up to him.

557
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:25,468
Sansa, look at me.

558
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:33,384
With Jon in the capital,

559
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:36,134
you'll be the true power
in the North.

560
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:38,009
I'd feel much better
about the future

561
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:39,426
if I left here today believing

562
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:41,092
that you and Daenerys
were allies.

563
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:44,926
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

564
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,676
Your queen
still has her dragons--

565
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,926
She's your queen too.

566
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:57,217
You don't have to be her friend.

567
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,217
But why provoke her?

568
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,551
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

569
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,051
-or the North, or--?
-You're afraid of her.

570
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:10,843
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

571
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:15,718
I don't want Jon
to go down there.

572
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:19,468
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

573
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:22,259
No, but as your brother
once told me,

574
00:46:22,343 --> 00:46:23,718
he's not a Stark.

575
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,676
Are you all right?

576
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:39,760
Her people love her,
you've seen that.

577
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:42,176
You've seen
how they fight for her.

578
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:45,426
She wants to make the world
a better place.

579
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,843
I believe in her.

580
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:06,051
Tyrion.

581
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:11,468
What if there's someone else?

582
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,176
Someone better?

583
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:23,551
You're not gonna
ride the dragon south?

584
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:28,426
Just a horse.

585
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,926
Rhaegal needs to heal.

586
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:32,718
He doesn't need me
weighing him down.

587
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,134
You weigh as much as
two fleas fucking.

588
00:47:37,426 --> 00:47:39,092
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

589
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:42,843
We've had enough of the south.

590
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,967
The women down here
don't like me.

591
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,217
This is the North, you know.

592
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,885
And the Free Folk
are welcome to stay.

593
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:56,092
It isn't home.

594
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:57,635
We need room to wander.

595
00:47:57,718 --> 00:47:59,801
I'll take them
back through Castle Black

596
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:02,343
as soon as
the winter storms pass.

597
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,092
Back where we belong.

598
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,384
It's where he belongs too.

599
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:13,176
A direwolf has no place
in the south.

600
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,801
Will you take him with you?

601
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:20,009
He'll be happier up there.

602
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:22,343
So would you.

603
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,760
I wish I was going with you.

604
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:32,426
This is farewell, then.

605
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,676
You never know.

606
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,134
You've got the North in you.

607
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:47,092
The real North.

608
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:22,760
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

609
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:25,426
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

610
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:28,134
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we--

611
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:30,926
I'm sure he knows
how it happens, Sam.

612
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,885
If it's a boy,
we want to name him Jon.

613
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:41,718
I hope it's a girl.

614
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,676
You're the best friend
I ever had.

615
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:07,176
You too, Sam.

616
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:10,009
TYRION:
Think of the past 20 years.

617
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:13,926
The war, the murder, the misery.

618
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:16,426
All of it because
Robert Baratheon loved someone

619
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:18,426
who didn't love him back.

620
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:21,676
How many others know?

621
00:51:23,468 --> 00:51:26,092
Including us? Eight.

622
00:51:26,176 --> 00:51:28,259
Well, then
it's not a secret anymore.

623
00:51:28,343 --> 00:51:30,134
It's information.

624
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:33,551
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

625
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:35,051
Then what happens?

626
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,718
She loses the North.

627
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:39,593
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

628
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:41,092
No, it's worse than that.

629
00:51:41,176 --> 00:51:43,926
He has the better claim
to the throne.

630
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:46,217
He doesn't want the throne.

631
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:48,718
I'm not sure it matters
what he wants.

632
00:51:49,926 --> 00:51:53,176
The fact is,
people are drawn to him.

633
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:54,967
Wildlings, Northmen.

634
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:58,217
He's a war hero.

635
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:04,843
He loves our queen.

636
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:07,676
And she loves him.

637
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:12,301
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

638
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:14,509
She's his aunt.

639
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:15,926
That never stopped
a Targaryen before.

640
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:17,718
No, but Jon grew up
in Winterfell.

641
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,051
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

642
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:24,468
You know our queen
better than I do.

643
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:27,259
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

644
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:29,885
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

645
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,217
Something she has in common

646
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:33,885
with every monarch
who ever lived.

647
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,760
I worry about her state of mind.

648
00:52:35,843 --> 00:52:37,967
We are advisors to the queen.

649
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:41,384
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

650
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:51,384
We still have to take
King's Landing.

651
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:55,134
Maybe Cersei will win
and kill us all.

652
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:57,509
That would solve our problems.

653
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,509
Get to the skiff. Now!

654
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,051
SOLDIER 1:
Spears!

655
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:09,092
SOLDIER 2:
They're coming round again!

656
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,176
SOLDIER 3:
Go!

657
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:20,468
SOLDIER 4:
Clear!

658
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,426
SOLDIER 5:
Man your stations!

659
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:24,176
MISSANDEI: No!

660
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,676
SOLDIER 4: Go! Go!
SOLDIER 5: Clear!

661
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:21,468
Missandei?

662
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:24,301
Missandei!

663
00:56:30,384 --> 00:56:31,801
Missandei!

664
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:38,718
CERSEI:
Our message was well-received,
then?

665
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:42,092
QYBURN:
Your people have heard
the Usurper is coming.

666
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:44,676
They are grateful
for your protection

667
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,134
within the walls
of the Red Keep.

668
00:56:49,384 --> 00:56:51,343
You're certain about the dragon?

669
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:53,676
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

670
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,009
That must have been glorious.

671
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,343
The glory is yours, my queen.

672
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:04,343
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

673
00:57:04,426 --> 00:57:06,092
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

674
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:10,676
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

675
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,217
She's coming for you.

676
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:31,551
Of course she is.

677
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,051
Keep the gates open.

678
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:38,760
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

679
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,343
thousands
of innocent people first.

680
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:49,926
So much for
"the Breaker of Chains."

681
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:05,926
GREY WORM:
We will storm the city,
my queen.

682
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:09,217
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

683
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:10,384
VARYS:
Your Grace.

684
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:15,635
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

685
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:18,051
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

686
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:24,343
This is a mistake.

687
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:29,426
You saw my child
fall from the sky.

688
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:33,051
They took Missandei.

689
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,134
VARYS:
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

690
00:58:35,217 --> 00:58:39,426
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

691
00:58:39,509 --> 00:58:40,718
and the Dothraki,

692
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:42,967
tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

693
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:47,760
That is why Cersei is bringing
them into the Red Keep.

694
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:51,509
These are the people
you came here to protect.

695
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:53,217
I beg you, Your Grace.

696
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:57,009
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

697
00:58:57,092 --> 00:59:00,926
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

698
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,801
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

699
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:15,343
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

700
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:17,967
That is my destiny...

701
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:22,259
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

702
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:32,051
It could be a fortnight before
Jon and the allied armies

703
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,134
make it to King's Landing.

704
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:37,051
In the meantime,
demand Cersei surrender.

705
00:59:37,134 --> 00:59:40,468
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

706
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:44,509
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

707
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:47,009
we should make the effort.

708
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:49,967
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

709
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:53,801
But perhaps it's good
the people see

710
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:57,885
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

711
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:00,301
and Cersei Lannister refused.

712
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:03,426
They should know whom to blame

713
01:00:03,509 --> 01:00:05,635
when the sky
falls down upon them.

714
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:22,384
I've served tyrants
most of my life.

715
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:26,593
They all talk about destiny.

716
01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:29,926
She's a girl who walked
into a fire with three stones

717
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:32,676
and walked out
with three dragons.

718
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,509
How could she not
believe in destiny?

719
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:37,468
Perhaps that's the problem.

720
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,760
Her life has convinced her

721
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,718
that she was sent here
to save us all.

722
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:42,718
And how do you know she wasn't?

723
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:46,885
Then there's the problem
of Jon Snow.

724
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:56,176
Perhaps
it's actually a solution.

725
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:59,134
You know them both.

726
01:00:59,217 --> 01:01:02,343
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

727
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:09,384
He doesn't want the throne.

728
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:11,926
That's why he bent the knee.

729
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:14,092
Have you considered
the best ruler

730
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:16,593
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

731
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:18,967
We're discussing treason.

732
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,718
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

733
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:25,134
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

734
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:31,259
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man,

735
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:34,092
which makes him more appealing
to the lords of Westeros,

736
01:01:34,176 --> 01:01:36,426
whose support
we are going to need.

737
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:37,926
Joffrey was a man.

738
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:40,259
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

739
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:41,468
as I'm sure you'd agree.

740
01:01:41,551 --> 01:01:43,509
And he's the heir to the throne.

741
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:47,593
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

742
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:53,509
What about my earlier proposal?

743
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,801
They could rule together
as king and queen.

744
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:59,760
She's too strong for him.

745
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:03,384
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

746
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:06,551
He could temper
her worst impulses.

747
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:08,593
As you have?

748
01:02:11,676 --> 01:02:13,843
You're drinking quite a lot.

749
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:19,885
A Targaryen father
and a Stark mother.

750
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,885
Jon's the one man alive
who might actually be able

751
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:24,843
to keep the North
in the Seven Kingdoms.

752
01:02:24,926 --> 01:02:26,509
How many kings and queens
have you served?

753
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:27,967
Five? Six? I've lost count.

754
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,843
-You've always known my reasons.
-At a certain point,

755
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:31,551
you choose a person
you believe in,

756
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:33,134
and you fight for that person.

757
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,301
Even if you know it's a mistake?

758
01:02:37,134 --> 01:02:38,843
I believe in our queen.

759
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:43,593
She'll make the right choice.

760
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:48,051
With the help
of her loyal advisors.

761
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,176
You know
where my loyalty stands.

762
01:02:54,259 --> 01:02:56,551
You know I will never
betray the realm.

763
01:02:56,635 --> 01:02:57,926
What is the realm?

764
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:00,134
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

765
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:02,176
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

766
01:03:02,259 --> 01:03:04,217
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

767
01:03:04,301 --> 01:03:06,967
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

768
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:08,259
We don't know their names,

769
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,217
but they're just as real
as you and I.

770
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:11,509
They deserve to live.

771
01:03:11,593 --> 01:03:13,509
They deserve
food for their children.

772
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:21,551
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

773
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:26,343
So, what happens to her?

774
01:03:34,301 --> 01:03:35,509
Please.

775
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:38,885
Don't.

776
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,051
I've spoken
as honestly as I can.

777
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:50,259
Each of us has a choice to make.

778
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:54,259
I pray we choose wisely.

779
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:07,009
MAN 1:
I'm just about to start it.

780
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:08,509
WOMAN 1:
Good luck.

781
01:04:08,593 --> 01:04:10,509
MAN 2:
Protect shell
right up to the wall.

782
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:12,176
MAN 1:
All right,
I'll put another one on it.

783
01:04:12,259 --> 01:04:14,092
MAN 3:
He's headed down to the cellar.

784
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:16,217
I'll need a cart over here.

785
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:17,509
MAN 4:
That's it, thanks.

786
01:04:17,593 --> 01:04:19,176
Thank you.

787
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:20,593
WOMAN 2:
It's really heavy, mind you.

788
01:04:20,676 --> 01:04:21,926
MAN 5:
We need some more water.

789
01:04:22,009 --> 01:04:23,593
MAN 3:
Take it down there!

790
01:04:28,509 --> 01:04:30,926
...as are the rest
of her advisors.

791
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:34,301
What happened?

792
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:44,301
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

793
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,343
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

794
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:49,593
Missandei captured.

795
01:04:51,468 --> 01:04:55,635
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

796
01:04:55,718 --> 01:04:58,426
Seems like
I won't get the chance.

797
01:06:05,176 --> 01:06:07,801
They're going to destroy
that city.

798
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,343
You know they will.

799
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:12,718
JAIME:
Have you ever run away
from a fight?

800
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:17,092
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

801
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:19,301
You're better than she is.

802
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:21,926
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

803
01:06:22,009 --> 01:06:23,926
You don't need to die with her.

804
01:06:24,009 --> 01:06:25,551
Stay here.

805
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:28,760
Stay with me.

806
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:32,426
Please.

807
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:34,509
Stay.

808
01:06:41,176 --> 01:06:43,009
You think I'm a good man?

809
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,468
I pushed a boy
out a tower window,

810
01:06:50,551 --> 01:06:52,635
crippled him for life

811
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:53,718
for Cersei.

812
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:59,760
I strangled my cousin
with my own hands

813
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,885
just to get back to Cersei.

814
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:07,217
I would have murdered

815
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:11,509
every man, woman and child
in Riverrun

816
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:12,718
for Cersei.

817
01:07:21,593 --> 01:07:23,426
She's hateful.

818
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:26,551
And so am I.

819
01:10:01,635 --> 01:10:02,593
My lord.

820
01:10:05,926 --> 01:10:08,967
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
unconditional surrender

821
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:11,760
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

822
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:17,843
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's
unconditional surrender.

823
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:21,967
If she refuses, Missandei
of Naath will die here and now.

824
01:10:23,635 --> 01:10:24,635
Qyburn...

825
01:10:26,092 --> 01:10:27,885
you're a rational man.

826
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:30,926
Or so I flatter myself,
my lord.

827
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,468
We have a chance here,

828
01:10:33,718 --> 01:10:37,217
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

829
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:38,301
Yes.

830
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:41,009
Help me.

831
01:10:42,217 --> 01:10:45,092
I don't want to see
this city burn.

832
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:48,468
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

833
01:10:50,468 --> 01:10:53,426
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

834
01:10:55,635 --> 01:10:57,801
I-- I don't want to hear it.

835
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:00,301
Help me save this city.

836
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,926
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

837
01:11:05,009 --> 01:11:06,718
TYRION:
Your queen.

838
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:08,926
Cersei is
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

839
01:11:09,009 --> 01:11:10,134
You are her subject.

840
01:11:10,217 --> 01:11:12,259
Her reign is over.

841
01:11:12,343 --> 01:11:14,885
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

842
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:17,509
We understand
nothing of the sort.

843
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:21,384
Your queen's last dragon
is vulnerable.

844
01:11:21,468 --> 01:11:24,384
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

845
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:27,760
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan--

846
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,801
CAPTAIN:
Ready!

847
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:48,926
Nock!

848
01:11:51,801 --> 01:11:53,009
Draw!

849
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:02,134
I know you don't care
about your people.

850
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:05,885
Why should you?

851
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,967
They hate you and you hate them.

852
01:13:16,468 --> 01:13:18,926
But you're not a monster.

853
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,176
I know this.

854
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:27,134
I know this
because I've seen it.

855
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:33,468
You've always
loved your children.

856
01:13:35,468 --> 01:13:36,967
More than yourself,

857
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:39,426
more than Jaime...

858
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,676
more than anything.

859
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,301
I beg you.

860
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:53,967
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

861
01:13:57,509 --> 01:14:00,051
Your reign is over,

862
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:03,134
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

863
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,885
It doesn't mean
your baby has to die.

864
01:14:56,718 --> 01:15:00,384
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

865
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,426
Dracarys.

866
01:15:35,635 --> 01:15:37,259
No.
